# Project Summary: Quora-Like Web Application

This project is a simple question-and-answer platform inspired by Quora, built using Express.js and EJS templating. Here's a brief overview:

## Core Functionality
- Users can create, read, update, and delete posts (full CRUD operations)
- Each post has a unique ID (generated using UUID), username, and content
- Posts are stored in memory (array) rather than a database in this version

## Technical Implementation
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Frontend**: EJS templates with CSS styling resembling Quora's design
- **Routing**: RESTful API design pattern for post management
- **Data Handling**: Method override for PUT/DELETE requests, UUID for unique identifiers

## Key Features
- Homepage displaying all posts
- Detailed view for individual posts
- Post creation form
- Post editing functionality
- Post deletion capability
- Clean, responsive UI with Quora-inspired styling

This project serves as a foundation that could be expanded with features like user authentication, comments, upvoting, and database integration to create a more complete Quora clone.
