# Simon Says Game Rules

This is a digital version of the classic Simon Says memory game. Here's how to play:

1. **Starting the Game**: Press any key on your keyboard to begin.

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - The game will light up one of the four colored buttons (red, blue, yellow, or green).
   - Your task is to remember and repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
   - With each level, the sequence gets longer by one step.

3. **Sequence Memory**:
   - Level 1: One button will flash.
   - Level 2: The first button will flash, followed by a new random button.
   - Level 3 and up: The entire previous sequence will play, followed by a new random button.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Your score is the number of levels you complete successfully.
   - The game keeps track of your highest score (highscore).

5. **Game Over**:
   - If you click the wrong button in the sequence, the game ends.
   - The screen will briefly flash red and display your score and highscore.
   - Press any key to restart the game.

6. **Visual Cues**:
   - White flash: When the computer demonstrates the sequence
   - Khaki flash: When you click a button

The goal is to memorize and repeat increasingly longer sequences correctly to achieve the highest score possible.
